  * DAX Formulas – Create custom calculations.
  * Schemas (Star/Snowflake) – Optimize performance.
Benefits:
 > Accurate insights 
 > Better performance 
 > Simplified analysis

3) What are the different types of connections available in Power BI?

  --> TYPES OF CONNECTIONS 

 Import Mode                     ->          Loads data into Power BI for fast performance; requires scheduled refreshes.
Direct Query                     ->          Queries data directly from the source in real-time; no data is stored in Power BI.
Live Connection                  ->          Similar to Direct Query but mainly for OLAP models (e.g., SSAS); high performance.
Composite Mode                   ->          Hybrid of Import & Direct Query; balances performance and real-time needs.
Data verse & Power Platform      ->          Connects to Microsoft services like Dynamics 365, PowerApps.
Streaming Datasets               ->          For real-time data from IoT, logs; displays live but not stored long-term.
ODBC & Custom Connectors         ->          Connects via ODBC drivers or custom-built connectors.

4) How do you handle data transformation in Power BI? 

* Clean Data – Remove duplicates, filter rows, replace nulls, trim text.
* Reshape Data – Split/merge columns, pivot/unpivot tables.
* Transform Data – Change data types, create custom columns, group/aggregate data.
* Combine Data – Merge (joins) and append (stack) queries.
* Optimize Performance – Remove unnecessary columns/rows before loading.
* Use M Language – Write advanced custom transformations.

After transformation, data is loaded into Power BI’s Data Model for further analysis using DAX.

5) What is DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and why is it important in
Power BI? 

--> DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language in Power BI used for
 custom calculations in measures, columns, and tables.

 DAX Important?
* Performs advanced calculations 📊
* Enhances data analysis with KPIs 📈
* Optimizes performance for large datasets ⚡
* Supports time intelligence (YTD, MTD) ⏳

 Functions:
 SUM(), COUNT(), AVERAGE() – Aggregations
 CALCULATE()               – Modify filter context
 FILTER(), ALL()           – Data filtering
 TIME INTELLIGENCE         – YTD, MTD


6) Can you explain the difference between calculated columns and
measures in Power BI?

Calculated Column :
Storage	              --> Stored in the data model (increases file size)
Calculation Context   --> Row-by-row calculation	
Performance           --> Slower for large datasets	
Usage	              --> Used in slicers, filters, relationships	
Example               --> Total Price = Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Unit Price]

Measure :
Storage	              --> Computed dynamically (no extra storage)                         	
Calculation Context   --> Aggregates based on filter	
Performance           --> Faster & efficient	
Usage	              --> Used in visuals, tables, KPIs	
Example               --> Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Total Price])

7) How do you handle relationships between tables in Power BI? 

Relationships in Power BI
* Create in Model View (Auto or Manual).
*Types:
       One-to-Many (1:*), 
       Many-to-Many (:), 
       One-to-One (1:1).
* Settings: Cardinality, Cross-Filter (Single/Both), Active/Inactive.
* DAX: RELATED(), LOOKUPVALUE(), RELATEDTABLE().
